## Folder contents:

mySolutions and the providedSolutions folders contain the files with same name that are:

## File description

- <ins>50_states.csv</ins> is where the data which consist of the coordinates on the map as well as the state name are stored. 
- <ins>blank_states_img.gif</ins> is where theimage that is used for the background of the map
- <ins>main.py</ins> is where all the python code is run. In this python program the turtle as well as the pandas library are used. Pandas library is used to read the 50_states.csv file. Then the Turtle module is used to create the graphics and interactivity of the 50 states program. If I have maxed out 50 attempts, then the remaining states that I failed to answered will be stored in a file called 50_states.csv.
- <ins>states_to_learn.csv</ins> is where all the states that I fail to answer correctly after 50 attempts is stored.
