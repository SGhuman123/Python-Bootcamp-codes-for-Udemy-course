# Description

This is a weather tracking program that helps track whether you need to bring an umbrella on a particular day. In this program, I utilised the following API from Open Weather map through the link of:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecal

Then, I used the Twilio API to send a message to myself in the event that it might rain on the day itself.

## File description:
- main_github.py is my original code for the weather-tracker project,
- main 2.py is the provided code solution by the course instructor, Dr Angela Yu.

## Sidenotes:
- If you are planning to use the program please remember to adjust the values by looking at the comments in the .py files.
