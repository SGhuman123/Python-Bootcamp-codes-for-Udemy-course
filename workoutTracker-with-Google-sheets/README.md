# Description

This describes how my workout tracker works. First, I use this API called Nutritionix API to get the exercise statistics based on the exercise I did saw for example I said "I ran for 10km". From this API I would obtain the necessary statistics such as :
- date: "29/12/2022"
- time: "13:57:24"
- exercise: "running"
- duration: "62.15min"
- calories: 786.72

This information is then filled up onto a google sheet with the aid of the Sheety API. To produce the result as seen here.
