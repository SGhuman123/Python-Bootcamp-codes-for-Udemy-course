# Description 

In this project I created a stock news trading program to monitor the price of Tesla stock. How it works is that if the closing price of the Tesla stock has a more than 5% increase or decrease from the previous day, users would then be notified via message about the change in price as well as the top 3 news articles related to Tesla. To run this program I utilised 3 different API's. They are:

- Alphavantage API, this is to obtain the price of Tesla stock.
- newsapi, this is to get the first 3 articles related to the company which in this case is Tesla.
- Twilio API, this is to send messages to users if there is a major change in price.
