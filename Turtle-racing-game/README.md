# Description

</br>

Here is how the turtle racing game works. 
</br>
turtle_race_start.py 
</br>
This is the file for my original code to the turtle racing game.
</br>

sol_turtle_race_final.py
</br>
This is the file for the code solution to the turtle racing game.

</br>
How this program works is that it first ask users to bet which turtle they believe would finish the race first. Subsequently the turtles are set to be in a position that is along the same starting line. Users then get to see if the turtle they bet in fact ends up winning the race.
