# Description

## How the game works:

In this game, I create a turtle crossing game where the turtle is not allowed to hit the cars as it attempts to reach the end of the road. Once it reaches the end of the road, the turtle would then progress on to the next level where cars now move at faster speeds that make it harder for the turtle to reach the end of the road. In the event that the turtle collides with any of the cars, it would be game over. 

## The folders are:
- myCode
- solutionCode

myCode folder consist of the original code that I used for this turtle crossy-road program. 
solutionCode folder consist of the code which is the solution by the course instructor Dr Angela Yu used for this program.
