# Description

In this folder we observe 2 files. One is my own spirography.py file which is from my own code the other is the spirograph_sol.py file which is provided by Dr Angela Yu. This program was made through the use of the Turtle, Screen and colorgram libraries. This program works by first asking the user how many circles they wish to see followed by creating a spirograph based on the inputed number of circles. Moreover, the colour of each circle is chosen randomly based on random RGB values.
