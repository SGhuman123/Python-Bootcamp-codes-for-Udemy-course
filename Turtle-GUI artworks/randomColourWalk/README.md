# Description

This folder contains two files are they are:
- randomColorWalk.py which is from my own code. 
- randomColorWalkSol.py which is the provided code by the course instructor Dr Angela Yu.

Some highlights I'd like to mention:
- I had a slightly different approach in the sense that I created the function random_color() in my randomColorWalk.py that selects colors based on random RGB values. As compared to the provided solution that selects colors based on a list of colors.

Here's a clip for the program.
