# Description
 
In this folder there are 2 files which are:
- HirstPaintingProject.py that is my solution to the coding task
- HirstPaintingProjectSol.py that is the provided solution to the coding task.

Some notable differences are that mine assigns colours of the dots based on a random RGB generator whereas the provided solution generates colors of the dots based on a list of RGB values.
